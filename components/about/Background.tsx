          Hi, I&apos;m Richard van Brunschot. Originally from Eindhoven, NL, but
          in 2021 my girlfriend and I moved to Lommel, BE. I&apos;m currently
          working as a front-end engineer at{' '}
          <a className="underline" href="https://trifork.com" target="__blank">

          </a>
          .

          While studying Computer Animation/VFX at the Netherlands Film Academy,
          I specialized in creating high-end 3D models for games and virtual
          reality. However, during my graduation year, I realized that I wanted
          to focus more on coding and software development. This led me to
          pursue front-end development, which turned out to be the perfect fit
          for me.
